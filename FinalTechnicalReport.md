## Introduction

In our ever increasingly mobile first world, applications with location awareness have become increasingly popular and useful. 
Within this technology trend, an application of geofences has arisen. A geofence is a part of a software program 
that uses GPS, WiFi or RFID to define geographical boundaries. With pushes in technology towards augmented reality, self-driving 
cars and IoT the need for location aware machines is becoming increasingly necessary.

This project is intended to provide a microservice that allows a client to query the service and determine if a point is contained within
a polygon or geofence.


Point-in-Polygon detection algorithms are common tools used to implement geofences.
