# Capstone Project
This project is a Geofencing Microservice. This service allows you to make queries to determine if a point is contained in a set of polygons. This repository also includes a React app as a way to demonstrate functionality of the microservice. Using the frontend app you can test the point-in-polygon service on the backend. You can find information on running the React app and microservice in the frontend and backend folders, respectively.
